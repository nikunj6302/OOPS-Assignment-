What is Object Oriented Programing(OOP)?\n"," - OOP is a basicaly clasification of function and call a function to the object oriented with the specific class as a variable or argument.\n","\n","2. What is Class in OPPS?\n"," - Class is a group of functions or methods that can easly access by the variable and classify the functions in a arragment.\n","\n","3. What is an object is OOPS?\n"," - The object is a variable or argument that is oparated by the function belongs to that specific class where the object variable is oriented.\n","\n","4. what is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?\n"," - Abstraction means to hide some code that is complex or unnececcary which is done by a decorator while encapsulation means to privatize the code make the method private in a class, which id done by two underscore  before any methods in class.\n","\n","5. Wht are dunder method in python?\n"," - To get any variable value outside of the class we use dunder methon __init__ which is used to get variable value inside class and store in a self.variabe method.\n","\n","6. Explain the concept of inheritance in OOPS?\n"," - Inheritace is basicaly two or more classes are associate with each other or one of them depends on other. There are mainly four types of inheritance in OOPS single, multilevel, multiple and hierachial inheritance.\n","\n","7. What is Polymorphism in OOPS?\n"," - Polymorphisms means many forms or many states, in these and object is oriented in more than one class and they can oparate more than one methods in same or different classes.\n","\n","8. How encapsulation achieved in Python?\n"," - As previously, Encapsulation is to make some methods are private, to achieve it need to write two '_' before any function or method and to call that private function we can write object_Class__encapulatinmethod().\n","\n","9. What is constructor in Python?\n"," - A constructor in Python is a special method used to initialize objects of a class. It is automatically called when an object is created. The constructor's primary purpose is to set up the initial state of the object by assigning values to its attributes. In Python, the constructor is named __init__.\n","\n","10. What are class and static method in Python?\n"," - As we previously discuss the class in classification of methods and static method is a decorator of a class it is basical a pre define method that help us to easily call any methods to oriented object.\n","\n","11. What is mehod Overloading in Python?\n"," - In side a same a class there are more than one methods with same name, they are operate as method overloading as the most recent method will operate the object.\n","\n","12. What is method Overriding in Python?\n"," - In two or more class there are methods with same name name in thatcase the method assign in child class will operate.\n","\n","13. What is Property decorator in Python?\n"," - The property decorator is used to call and access the private method inside the classs.\n","\n","14. Why is polymorphysm is importante in oops.\n"," - In the case of many methods with same name and argument, the polymorphysm says which method works wuth this situation.\n","\n","15. What is abstract class in Python?\n"," - It is a decorator that helps to hide some unnececcary methods or complex methods that does not make private them, the methods are hidden.\n","\n","16. What are the advantages of OOPS?\n"," - OOPS is used to make code well arranged and clasifying the functiona we can easily call any function whenever we need.\n","\n","17. What is difference between a class variable and instance variable?\n"," - Class variables are shared by all instances of the class, while instance variables are unique to each instance. instance variable are assing by __init__ method while class variable are assign outside of any method.\n","\n","18. What is multiple inheritance in Python?\n"," - When there are two indipendent parent class are assing to a child class is callded multiple inheritance.\n","\n","19. Explain the method of '__str__' and '__repr__' methods in Python?\n"," - __str__(self): This method returns a human-readable, informal string representation of an object. __repr__(self): This method returns a more technical, unambiguous string representation of an object. Ideally, the string returned by __repr__ should be a valid Python expression that could be used to recreate the object.\n","\n","20. What is significance of the 'super()' function in Python?\n"," - The super() function in Python is used to call methods from a parent class in a subclass. It returns a proxy object that delegates method calls to a parent or sibling class.\n","\n","21. What is teh significance of the __del__ method in Python?\n"," - __del__ method is to delet unnececcary methods which are useless now but not when they are created.\n","\n","22. What is difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod in Python?\n"," - using @staticmethod we can easily call a function in a class without any object oriented with perticular class while in @classmetho we can also call the function easily and also it is used to add any external function in predefine class earlier.\n","\n","23. How does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance?\n"," - Polymorphism is work as method overloading and overriding in Python with inherritance. Overloading used the most recent method with a perticular argument is called. While in Overriding the child class will become supreme and take override the methods of parent class.\n","\n","24. What is method chaining in Python OOP?\n"," - This is achieved by having each method return the object instance (self) after performing its operation. This allows for a more concise and readable way to perform a series of actions on an object.\n","\n","25. What is the purpose of the __call__ method in Python?\n"," - The __call__ method in Python enables instances of a class to be called like regular functions. When a class implements the __call__ method, its instances become callable objects.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"heT6Q9qd8sUt"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["#Practical
